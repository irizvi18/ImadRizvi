For sale:<br />
Manahal Tabassum (1)<br />
Condition: Like New<br />
<br />
Looking for a wholesome Pakistani man of approximately the same age to make her laugh (and get a life)
<br />
<br />Age: 19 (legal)
<br />University: Yale (low supply, high demand) 
<br />Location: NYC and does not let you forget it
<br />Height: “my height is not important” but honestly of average height
<br />Languages: speaks many tongues 👅 including Urdu, English, AND Spanish but barely. one of the items on her bucket list is to learn more! so feel free to teach her something new😝 

<br />Pros:
<br />- Computer Science major making actual BIG bucks this summer and could be your sugar mommy (dm to find out how many 0s there are in her bank account) 💵💵💵
<br />- vvvv nice and possibly the sweetest person on campus: got up at 5:30 on valentines day to buy a present for me and other friends (but don’t worry I’m a female you have no competition)
<br />- A sucker for romcoms (just kidding your competition is ryan gosling)
<br />- Has infinite hope in people but 0 hope in brown fuckbois so please prove her wrong
<br />- her LOVE for food is how much she’ll love YOU and she is down to try ANYTHING 😛  
<br />- GYMS so she’s PEACHY 🍑🍑🍑 and healthy 
<br />- she loves EVERYTHING BANANA: banana bread, banana bread pudding, chunky monkey ice cream, banana cream pie  and last but not least other banana things too 😮
<br />- somewhat brown — will rewatch Kapoor and Sons for the twentieth time with you and SOB

<br />Cons:
<br />- mostly sober (but see video for when she does drink… 💦💦) 
<br />- can only cook exactly according to recipes
<br />- cannot eat spicy (hence, a bit vanilla) 
<br />- a bit dramatic: her feels are dialed up to 100 all the time
<br />- is friends with everyone

<br />Possibly a Pro, Maybe a Con? You Decide.
<br />- can never say no to anything 😉

<br />Requirements:
<br />Be charming. 
<br />Preferably above 5’10” but not a hard requirement because Manahal loves anyone and everyone with a big HEART 😉. 
<br />Secret to wooing Manahal: white flowers and she will melt at your feet.�
<br />ADD SOME SPICE TO HER LIFE! Please be her Fawad Khan so she’ll stop complaining about being single and walking into my room!! 
<br />DM her on FB or insta (mana.halt) — you can be the number one thing for her to DO on her bucket list!
