Manahal Tabassum (1)
Condition: Like New

Looking for a wholesome Pakistani man of approximately the same age to make her laugh (and get a life)

Age: 19 (legal)
University: Yale (low supply, high demand) 
Location: NYC and does not let you forget it
Height: “my height is not important” but honestly of average height
Languages: speaks many tongues 👅 including Urdu, English, AND Spanish but barely. one of the items on her bucket list is to learn more! so feel free to teach her something new😝 

Pros:
- Computer Science major making actual BIG bucks this summer and could be your sugar mommy (dm to find out how many 0s there are in her bank account) 💵💵💵
- vvvv nice and possibly the sweetest person on campus: got up at 5:30 on valentines day to buy a present for me and other friends (but don’t worry I’m a female you have no competition)
- A sucker for romcoms (just kidding your competition is ryan gosling)
- Has infinite hope in people but 0 hope in brown fuckbois so please prove her wrong
- her LOVE for food is how much she’ll love YOU and she is down to try ANYTHING 😛  
- GYMS so she’s PEACHY 🍑🍑🍑 and healthy 
- she loves EVERYTHING BANANA: banana bread, banana bread pudding, chunky monkey ice cream, banana cream pie  and last but not least other banana things too 😮
- somewhat brown — will rewatch Kapoor and Sons for the twentieth time with you and SOB

Cons:
- mostly sober (but see video for when she does drink… 💦💦) 
- can only cook exactly according to recipes
- cannot eat spicy (hence, a bit vanilla) 
- a bit dramatic: her feels are dialed up to 100 all the time
- is friends with everyone

Possibly a Pro, Maybe a Con? You Decide.
- can never say no to anything 😉

Requirements:
Be charming. 
Preferably above 5’10” but not a hard requirement because Manahal loves anyone and everyone with a big HEART 😉.
