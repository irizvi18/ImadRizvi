Looking for a wholesome Pakistani man of approximately the same age to make her laugh (and get a life)

Age: 19 (legal)
University: Yale (low supply, high demand) 
Location: NYC and does not let you forget it
Height: “my height is not important” but honestly of average height
Languages: speaks many tongues including Urdu, English, AND Spanish but barely. one of the items on her bucket list is to learn more! so feel free to teach her something new

Pros:
- Computer Science major making actual BIG bucks this summer and could be your sugar mommy (dm to find out how many 0s there are in her bank account)
- vvvv nice and possibly the sweetest person on campus: got up at 5:30 on valentines day to buy a present for me and other friends (but don’t worry I’m a female you have no competition)
- A sucker for romcoms (just kidding your competition is ryan gosling)
- Has infinite hope in people but 0 hope in brown fuckbois so please prove her wrong
- her LOVE for food is how much she’ll love YOU and she is down to try ANYTHING   
- GYMS so she’s PEACHY and healthy 
- she loves EVERYTHING BANANA: banana bread, banana bread pudding, chunky monkey ice cream, banana cream pie  and last but not least other banana things too 
- somewhat brown — will rewatch Kapoor and Sons for the twentieth time with you and SOB

Cons:
- mostly sober (but see video for when she does drink… ) 
- can only cook exactly according to recipes
- cannot eat spicy (hence, a bit vanilla) 
- a bit dramatic: her feels are dialed up to 100 all the time
- is friends with everyone

Possibly a Pro, Maybe a Con? You Decide.
- can never say no to anything 

Requirements:
Be charming. 
Preferably above 5’10” but not a hard requirement because Manahal loves anyone and everyone with a big HEART.
