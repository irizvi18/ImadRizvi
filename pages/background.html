	<h1> Background </h1>


	 <p><div class="backText">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Imad Hasan Rizvi, and I was born in Hartford, CT on February, 24, 2000. I have lived in Connecticut my whole life, moving to Glastonbury when I was young and eventually attending Choate Rosemary Hall and Yale University. My family is from Pakistan, but currently lives all around the United States, as far as Texas and Oregon. From a young age, I was always interested in math and problem solving. I started doing math competitions in elementary school, and that, along with chess, was my main focus until I reached high school. I participated on my middle school's Mathcounts team, placing second overall in the state for the head to head round, and helping our team to an overall second place finish. I also was very passionate about Chess, competing in tournaments many weekends in elementary and middle school. When I reached high school, my interest in theoretical math shifted more towards applying it into different fields: I became very interested in statistics, economics, and computer science. I was able to captain my high school's economics team to a fourth place finish nationally in the National Economics Challenge. Besides these quantitative subjects, I also developed a strong passion for writing and politics that begin with the contemporary issues course I took freshman year. Eventually, this led me to co-found an Economics publication called <a href="http://thecurrency.choate.edu/">The Currency Magazine </a>. At Yale, I have continued exploring all my fields of interest, writing for the Yale Politic, coding for Havenly Treats, and working as an analyst for the Yale Student Investment Group.</div> </p>
