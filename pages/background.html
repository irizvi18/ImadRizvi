	<h1> Background </h1>


	 <p><div class="backText">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Imad Hasan Rizvi, and I was born in Hartford, CT in 2000. I have lived in Connecticut my whole life, moving to Glastonbury when I was young and eventually attending Choate Rosemary Hall and Yale University. My family is from Pakistan, but currently lives all around the United States, as far as Texas and Oregon. My biggest academic interests are math, computer science, statistics, and economics. I also love to write and closely follow politics; one of my favorite extracurriculars at Choate was running an Economics/Politics publication called <a href="http://thecurrency.choate.edu/">The Currency Magazine </a>. Outside of my academic interests, I also have a passion for learning languages (currently studying Portuguese and Dutch), soccer (huge EPL and Manchester City fan), and standup comedy (ranging from Kumail Nanjiani to Trevor Noah to Anthony Jeselnik).
