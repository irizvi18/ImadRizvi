	 <p>This is my website from high school. Modifications in later years but the content is not kept fully up to date. <br>I grew up in Glastonbury, attended Choate Rosemary Hall for high school, and graduated with a BS in Computer Science & Economics as well as a BS in Statistics & Data Science from Yale College. Out of college I joined Citadel Securities where I work as an Analyst trading options, specifically focused on Industrials + Clean Energy stocks. I live in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. </p>
