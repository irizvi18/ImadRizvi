	<h1> Welcome to an elusive group of those who get to celebrate Imad's quarterlife crisis.</h1>
	<p> When my parents, and my parent's parents, and my parent's parent's parents were this age, they had fought wars and started families. The biggest accomplishments in my 25 years is clicking a tiny button on one of four monitors REALLY quickly when the richest person of all time shitposts.</p>
	<p> So please join me this weekend in drinking to commiserate a failure of a 25 years that would've disappointed generations of my foremothers and forefathers.</p>
	<p> I know most of you have had similarly disappointing first quarter centuries. So this weekend is a chance to make a contribution bigger than yourself, for the charity of your choice. </p>
	<p> The stakes are high. There is a pool of $500 (which will be charity match'ed by a company to $1k) to be given away to charity. I also welcome further donations to this charity pool.</p>
	<p> But for some of you, the charity stakes are not high enough. I saw some of your weak attempts last year.</p>
  <p> All $500 is currently on pace to be donated to the <a href="https://secured.heritage.org/"> Heritage Foundation </a> as a bitcoin donation (because that makes it even more insufferable). I'd hate for y'all to be responsible but I really will fucking do it and its not my fault if the money goes there. </p>
  <p> Every 2 points that is won by you corresponds to $1 being transferred away from the Heritage Foundation and towards a pool for the charities of your choice.</p>
	<p> And then whoever comes in the top 4 will win $50, $100, $150, $200 for your charities respectively (which will then be doubled). Points will be accumulated through generation engagement and through a set of challenges</p>
  <p> Good luck. The count has already started</p>
