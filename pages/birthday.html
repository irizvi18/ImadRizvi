	<h1> Imad's 22nd Birthday Party! </h1>
	<p> I hope you can make it! Over the next few weeks, I will provide all updates related to logistics and activities here. Please feel free to message me if you have any ideas! </p>
	<p> The party will take place on Friday, February 25 at 8:00 PM at Tandoor Restaurant New Haven.
	<p> Random Announcements: </p>
	<p> I need someone at approximately 7-8 PM to help me taste test all the cocktails. You can do the thing where you only take a sip and then swirl it in your mouth and spit it out, but you still might get drunk, so probably someone with a decent tolerance is preferred.</p>
	<p> Please give me ideas for what to fill a piñata with. </p>
	<p> PLEASE GET TESTED ON WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY.</p>
	
	<p> Food: </p>
	<p> Tandoor will serve papadum and samosas, but I couldn't afford the little sauce things they give on the side so you have to eat them raw. If that's a problem, bring your own. </p>
	<p> Drinks: </p>
	<p> <b><i>Imadgarita: </b></i>An Imadgarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice often served with salt on the rim of the glass. The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen Imadgarita), or without ice (straight up). Although it has become acceptable to serve an Imadgarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in the eponymous Imadgarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe.</p>
	<p> <b><i>Mancity Mule:</b></i> A Mancity Mule is a blue-colored cocktail made with vodka, spicy ginger beer, and lime juice, garnished with a slice or wedge of lime. It is a type of buck; therefore, sometimes called a vodka buck. The Moscow mule is popularly served in a copper mug, which takes on the cold temperature of the liquid.</p>
	<p> <b><i>Pakistani Pale Ale:</b></i> The less commonly known variant of an IPA, the Pakistani pale ale is a hoppy beer style within the broader category of pale ale. The style of pale ale which became known as Pakistani pale ale was widespread in England by 1815, and would grow in popularity, notably as an export beer shipped to Pakistan and elsewhere.</p>
	<p> Activities: </p>
	<p>Activities will consist of party games, a roast (with material from Ben, Avi, Jonah, Katie, Sonia + Rabhya, Michael), a piñata, and more ideas to come.</p>
