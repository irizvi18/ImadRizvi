	<p>You clicked my eyes. In high school I had this page show all the opinion articles I had written for the Choate News and The Currency Magazine to show how I "see" the world. But all of those articles were taken down and it was funny to later see articles I wrote when I was 15-16 entitled "Embrace Immigrants", "Reform the Electoral College", "Why a $15 Minimum Wage is Necessary", etc. One time I was assigned to write a piece about the Colombia/FARC peace deal which I didn't want to take a stance on because I knew nothing, so I wrote a neutral article explaining both sides. The Opinions section editor cut half of it, inserted an opinion for me against the deal and called it "Colombians Deserve More than Peace; They Deserve Justice" and then I got a lot of hate mail from Colombian alumni.</p>
