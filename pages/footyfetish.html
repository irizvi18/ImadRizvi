	<h1>Footy Fetish: The World Cup On and Beyond the Pitch</h1>
	<p>This 12-week course catered for complete beginner but also intermediate soccer fans is aimed at getting students ready and knowledgeable ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Students will learn about the game and tournament itself as well as significant cultural, political, and economic themes associated with the World Cup. By the end of the course students should feel comfortable heading to a pub/stadium to watch a World Cup game this summer and sound like they actually know ball. For those who miss the routine of coursework (complete with problem sets, in class discussions, graded assessments), those who need a hobby (there is plenty of time to ramp ahead of this summer), or those who want to at minimum become the peak performative footy fan (or at best become a football hooligan/thug/ultra). You will leave the course with a team to support and a certification as an official Level 1 CFA (Chartered Footy Analyst).</p>
	<p>This course will be a 3 hour per week commitment including 1.5 hours per week live lectures in our apartment in Prospect Heights. Courses will begin the first week of March.</p>
	<p>Enrollment is capped. Please spend 10 mins on the application here: <a href="https://forms.gle/bspAdvarxh4PysBv5" Google Form</a></p>
	<p>We also have space for one more TA so reach out to Prof. Rizvi directly if interested.</p>
